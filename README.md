# PPGEEC2318 Machine Learning

### Student: Paulo Eduardo da Silva Júnior

### Objective:
 - Create five videos, one for each of the first five chapters of __Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen__ summarizing the key points of its respective chapter.

`All material produced in this repository was obtained from reading the book Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen.`

## Chapter 1: Overview of Machine Learning Systems

#### Abstract:
This chapter discusses how Machine Learning (ML) systems have been integrated on a large scale, especially after advances such as Google's neural translation system. It explains that although ML has become an essential technology in several industries, its practical use requires a complex framework that goes far beyond algorithms.

## Chapter 2: Introduction to Machine Learning

#### Abstract:
The chapter explores how to plan and build Machine Learning (ML) systems, highlighting that the design of an ML system must consider the context of MLOps and all its components, such as business objectives, infrastructure, monitoring, and system adaptation.

## Chapter 5: Feature Engineering

#### Abstract:
• The chapter explores how to create and manage relevant features to improve the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) models. Feature engineering is vital to the success of ML projects, requiring domain expertise and best practices such as temporal division of data, appropriate scaling, and constant monitoring of the features used.
