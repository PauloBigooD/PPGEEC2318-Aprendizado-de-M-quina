### Student: Paulo Eduardo da Silva JÃºnior

### Objective:
 - Create five videos, one for each of the first five chapters of Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen summarizing the key points of its respective chapter.

## Chapter 1: Overview of Machine Learning Systems

#### Abstract:
This chapter discusses how Machine Learning (ML) systems have been integrated on a large scale, especially after advances such as Google's neural translation system. It explains that although ML has become an essential technology in several industries, its practical use requires a complex framework that goes far beyond algorithms.
